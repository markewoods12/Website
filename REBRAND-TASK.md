## TIER 1 — Fix What's Wrong

1. **Rewrite hero** — "Product Executive" or "Chief Product Officer" NOT "Software Engineer & Builder". Tagline should reflect digital assets + product leadership. Keep the Fraunces italic name treatment.

2. **Add headshot** to hero — use `WoodsHeadshots-24.jpg`. Premium look (circular or rounded, subtle border/glow).

3. **Real social links everywhere** (Footer + Contact):
   - GitHub: https://github.com/markewoods12
   - LinkedIn: https://linkedin.com/in/mark-e-woods
   - Twitter/X: https://x.com/markewoods12

4. **Fix About page:**
   - Title: "Chief Product Officer" not "Head of Product"
   - Location: Radford, VA (not Blacksburg)
   - Bio leads with CPO of Bullish, breadth across exchange + media + data + indices

5. **Replace ALL fake projects** with real work:
   - Bullish Exchange — product leadership across spot, derivatives, custody
   - CoinDesk Media & Data — editorial product + market data platform
   - Content Engine (personal) — AI-powered content pipeline
   - Market Intelligence Dashboard (personal) — crypto competitive intelligence
   - This Website — Next.js + Tailwind + MDX
   - Remove all placeholder links. Only real links.

6. **Fix metadata** — all titles/descriptions: "Product Executive" not "Software Engineer"

## TIER 2 — Build the Brand

7. **New homepage "What I Do" section** — 3 pillars as cards:
   - 🏛️ Digital Assets — "Leading product strategy for one of the world's most technically advanced digital asset exchanges"
   - 🤖 AI × Product — "Exploring how AI transforms product management, content creation, and decision-making"
   - 🎯 Leadership — "Building and scaling high-performing product and design organizations"

8. **New "/now" page** (nownownow.com style):
   - Running product + design at Bullish
   - Building AI-powered tools for content and market intelligence
   - Writing about digital assets and product leadership
   - Mentoring with The First Tee
   - Add "Now" to navbar

9. **Newsletter CTA** on homepage — email input UI, can be non-functional for now.

10. **Contact form** — make button open mailto:hello@markewoods.com at minimum.

11. **Write 3 real blog posts (MDX):**
    - "The Future of Digital Asset Exchanges" (800-1000 words)
    - "How AI Is Changing Product Management" (800-1000 words)
    - "Building in Public: Why I Started Writing" (600-800 words)
    - Voice: first-person, conversational, opinionated. NOT corporate. Dates in Feb 2026.

## TIER 3 — Polish

12. **OG image** — dark bg, gold accent, "Mark Woods" text. Wire in layout metadata.

13. **Subtle Bullish mention** in hero or footer.

14. **Responsive** — all new sections work on mobile.

15. **Navbar:** About, Now, Projects, Blog, Contact

16. **Footer:** real links, tagline "CPO @ Bullish · Building at the intersection of finance and technology"

## DESIGN GUIDELINES

- Keep numbered section pattern (01, 02, 03...)
- Minimal editorial aesthetic, no flashy new animations
- Dense but readable — minimize scrolling
- Senior executive who's also technical, NOT a dev portfolio

## WHEN DONE
- Commit all changes with descriptive message
- Do NOT delete this task file
