## Pre-Publish Checklist

### Content Review
- [ ] Post has a clear, specific title (not generic)
- [ ] Excerpt is 1–2 sentences, compelling, and accurate
- [ ] Content is first-person, opinionated, and not generic
- [ ] No confidential Bullish Group information included
- [ ] No material non-public information (MNPI) included
- [ ] No forward-looking statements about $BLSH performance
- [ ] All claims are accurate and verifiable
- [ ] Any market predictions are clearly labeled as opinion

### Compliance
- [ ] `disclaimer` frontmatter field is set:
  - `"standard"` — for most posts (leadership, AI, product)
  - `"market-commentary"` — for posts discussing digital asset prices/markets
  - `"none"` — for non-financial content only (use sparingly)
- [ ] If post mentions specific digital assets by name, use `"market-commentary"` variant
- [ ] Reviewed against Bullish social media / external comms policy (if applicable)

### Frontmatter
- [ ] `title` is set
- [ ] `date` is set (format: `"YYYY-MM-DD"`)
- [ ] `excerpt` is set (1–2 sentences)
- [ ] `tags` are set (2–5 relevant tags)
- [ ] `disclaimer` is set (see above)
- [ ] `pinned: true` only if this is the single featured post (remove from previous pinned post)

### Technical
- [ ] File is saved as `/content/blog/[slug].mdx`
- [ ] Slug is URL-friendly (lowercase, hyphens, no special characters)
- [ ] All internal links use `/writing/` (not `/blog/`)
- [ ] No broken links
- [ ] Images are in `/public/` and properly referenced

### Final Check
- [ ] Read the full post aloud (catches awkward sentences)
- [ ] Check that it adds value — does someone walk away having learned something or thought differently?
- [ ] Would you be comfortable if your boss, your lawyer, and a journalist all read this?
