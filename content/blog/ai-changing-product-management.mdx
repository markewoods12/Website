excerpt: "AI isn't replacing product managers. But it is changing what the job actually is — which skills matter, which tasks disappear, and where PMs need to invest their energy."

There's a version of the AI-replaces-PMs narrative that gets passed around LinkedIn and it's mostly wrong. But there's another version — quieter, more honest — that I think is actually true: AI is changing what good product management looks like, and the PMs who don't adapt will find themselves competing with AI for work they used to own.

Let me tell you what I've actually observed over the last couple of years, running a product organization and building AI tools myself.

## The Work That's Actually Changing

### Research is table stakes now

User research synthesis used to take days. You'd run interviews, transcribe them, code them thematically, look for patterns. Now you can do a rough version of that in an afternoon.

This doesn't mean research matters less — it means the bar has risen. If you can synthesize 20 user interviews in a day, you should be doing 40 interviews. The PMs who are still running 5 interviews and calling it research are already behind.

### The first draft is free

PRDs, briefs, user stories, OKRs — AI can produce serviceable first drafts of all of them. This should be liberating, not threatening.

The PM's job was never to be a good typist. It was to know what to build and why, and to communicate that clearly enough that smart engineers and designers could act on it. AI gives you more time for the actual thinking by handling the mechanical writing.

### Data fluency is becoming table stakes

PMs always needed to be comfortable with data. Now the bar is higher. With AI, you can query databases without SQL expertise, prototype dashboards without engineers, and run basic statistical analysis without a data scientist. PMs who can't work with data directly are increasingly dependent on specialists for things they could just do themselves.

## The Work That Still Requires You

### Knowing what to build

This is the core of the job and AI is genuinely bad at it. AI can tell you what users are saying, but it can't tell you which of those things are worth solving, in what order, with what tradeoffs. That requires judgment built from experience, market context, and deep understanding of your company's strategic position.

No model has that context. No model has skin in the game. That judgment is still yours.

### Navigating organizations

The hardest part of product management isn't figuring out what to build — it's getting agreement on what to build from a group of smart people who all have different incentives, perspectives, and information. This is deeply human work.

Understanding why the CTO is resistant, how to bring the CFO along, when to push back on the CEO — AI can help you prepare for these conversations but it can't have them for you.

### Taste

Product taste — the ability to look at a design or a feature and know that it's not quite right, even when you can't articulate why immediately — is still irreducibly human. Maybe AI gets there someday. It's not there now.

## What I've Changed About My Own Work

I use AI constantly now. Not as a gimmick — as a genuine lever.

I use it to pressure-test my thinking. Before a big strategy presentation, I'll have a model argue the other side. It surfaces assumptions I've been carrying unchecked.

I use it to go from scattered notes to structured document quickly. Not to replace my thinking — to externalize it faster so I can see what's missing.

I use it to understand things outside my expertise faster. Market structures I don't know well, technical architectures my engineers describe, regulatory frameworks in new jurisdictions — I can get a working understanding in hours instead of days.

## The PM Who Adapts

The PM who succeeds with AI is the one who uses it to amplify their existing strengths rather than to paper over their weaknesses. If your value is judgment, use AI to free up time for more judgment. If your value is communication, use AI to communicate at higher volume with consistent quality.

The PM who doesn't adapt is the one doing work that AI can do — and doing it slower. The job of synthesizing research, writing the first-draft PRD, building the reporting deck — those tasks are going to be competed for by AI tools, and the humans who try to win on speed alone will lose.

The good news: the highest-leverage parts of the job — judgment, taste, organizational navigation, strategic clarity — are if anything becoming more important as the mechanical parts get automated. The question is whether you're investing in those capabilities or still competing on the stuff that's getting commoditized.

I know which side of that bet I'd rather be on.
