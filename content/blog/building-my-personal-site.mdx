# Building My Personal Site with Next.js and MDX

I've been meaning to build a personal website for a while now. After evaluating several options, I settled on **Next.js** with **Tailwind CSS** and **MDX** for the blog.

## Why This Stack?

### Next.js

Next.js gives me the best of both worlds — a great developer experience with React, plus static export capabilities so I can host the site anywhere. The App Router makes organizing pages intuitive.

### Tailwind CSS

I wanted a bold, modern design without spending weeks on custom CSS. Tailwind's utility-first approach lets me iterate on designs rapidly while keeping things consistent.

### MDX for Blogging

MDX is markdown on steroids. I can write blog posts in markdown but also embed React components when I need something interactive. The posts live as files in the repo, so there's no database to manage.

## What I Learned

1. **Static exports work great** for personal sites — no server needed
2. **`next-mdx-remote`** makes rendering MDX content straightforward
3. **Tailwind v4** simplified the setup with its new CSS-first configuration

## What's Next

I plan to add more interactive elements to blog posts, explore adding a dark/light theme toggle, and keep writing about the things I'm building.

Stay tuned for more posts!
