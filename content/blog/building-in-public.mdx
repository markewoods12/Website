I'm going to be honest: writing this feels a little uncomfortable.

I've spent over 15 years working on product strategy, building teams, and shipping things. I've had a front-row seat to some genuinely interesting moments — the early days of blockchain product development, the construction of a digital asset exchange from scratch, the chaos and growth of integrating major media and data businesses. I have opinions about all of it.

And I've shared exactly none of it publicly.

Part of that is professional caution. When you're a senior executive at a public company, you develop a careful relationship with what you say and where you say it. Compliance is real. Competitive sensitivity is real. The risk of misspeaking in a regulated industry is not theoretical.

But if I'm honest with myself, most of it was simpler than that: I just didn't think people would care. Who wants to read what some CPO in Virginia thinks about exchange architecture or AI-powered product management?

I'm changing that assumption. Here's why.

## The people who taught me didn't hide what they knew

The best things I've learned in my career didn't come from conference talks or business books. They came from people who thought out loud in public — writing blog posts, sharing their reasoning, arguing their positions and updating them when they were wrong.

Those people made me better. Some of them didn't know my name. Some of them still don't. But their willingness to share thinking openly had compounding value that they'll never fully see.

I want to be more like that.

## Working out loud sharpens the thinking

There's something that happens when you try to explain something in writing that doesn't happen in your head or even in conversation. The gaps show up. The assumptions surface. The places where your mental model doesn't quite hold together become visible.

I've been thinking about the future of digital asset exchanges for years. Now I'm writing about it, and I'm discovering that some of what I thought I believed doesn't survive contact with a blank page. That's useful.

## Someone is going to build in this space — why not share the map

Digital assets and AI are both early enough that there's not a lot of great writing about how to actually build products in these domains. There's plenty of speculation and hype. There's less honest, practitioner-level thinking about what works, what doesn't, and why.

I'm not claiming to have the definitive answers. But I've been doing this work seriously for a while, and I've learned some things the hard way. If I can share those lessons in a way that's useful to someone else — a PM early in their career, a founder trying to understand the space, an executive wrestling with a decision I've already made — that seems worth doing.

## The bar for starting is lower than I thought

I kept waiting until I had something definitive to say. Until I'd figured out the thing fully, until the insight was polished, until I was sure I wasn't going to embarrass myself.

That's a trap. Nobody writes perfectly formed thoughts the first time. The people whose writing I admire most are the ones who write clearly and honestly, even when the thinking is still in progress. Especially when it's still in progress.

So this is me starting. Not waiting until it's finished. Writing because the writing is part of how it gets finished.

I'm going to write about digital assets, about AI and product management, and about leadership — the real stuff, not the sanitized version. I'll probably be wrong about some things. I'll say so when I figure out I'm wrong.

If any of it is useful to you, I'd genuinely like to know. My email is on the contact page.
